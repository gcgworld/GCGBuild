###DONE###

###DONE###

1a) Pass vars into jailpurse immediately after copying it for the edit.

###DONE###
1b) functions can take fucking parameters.
	a) verbosity and logging are now parameters that get fed into every
		function and not 6-9 extra lines of code in a function.
###DONE###
Functions in bash can take parameters, unless you them in as variables.

	b) figure out how to break the generic helper functions into a 
		separate library. Create generic functions to help with sysadmin
		tasks while you're at it.


1c) dpkg-it-casual ~> jailpurse/bedroom needs to prove out.

1d) create man page.

	as laid out in the CIS guide.

1i) LXC support for virtual machines.


2) Put no weight on logging until acct and whowatch are investigated to serve

		DNSSEC
		v

4) Pick an http server, install that bitch with a site running.

5) Branding. Don't be tech, be a hipster. Swear a lot.

7) DNS check, by inquiring multiple servers in different regions, using basic 
	statistics to determine what's good.
