"Our Gangster Computer God is a benevolent Gangster Computer God.."

Usage: gcgbuild.sh [-options] [-b BASE_IMAGE]
Options:
    -b, --base-image: "/path/to/base_image.iso"

        Choose image to edit.

        example: gcgbuild -b images/base/ubuntu-desktop-14.04.05.iso


    -h, --help: Show this message and exit.
    
    
    -l, --log-dir: "\e[4m/path/to/log/dir\e[0m"
        Default is "\e[4m/var/log/gcg\e[0m"
    
        Select directory for changelog.
        If directory does not exist, gcg will
        attempt to create it.
    
        example: gcgbuild -l /tmp/gcg/changelog
                 gcgbuild --log-dir ~/log/gcg

    
    -L, --log-level:
        Default: "\e[4mInfo\e0m"

        0 = None   "No logging."
        1 = Entry  "Log commands issued editing."
        2 = Info   "Log files added/deleted changed."
        3 = Debug  "Log everything we can think of."


    -m, --mount-point: "\e[4m/path/to/mnt/dir\e[0m"
        Default: "\e[4m/mnt\e0m"
        
        Choose base directory to mount the 
        base image, the filesystem, create
        the copy of the filesystem to edit,
        and the copy of the image we will 
        add our changes too, and build from.

        Example: gcgbuild -m /tmp/gcg
                 gcgbuild --mount-point /opt/mountpoint

    
    -n, --no-networking:
        Default: "\e[4mnetwork=enabled\e0m"
        
        Prevent the guest system from 
        accessing your network from chroot
        jail.
        
        Example: gcgbuild -n
                 gcgbuild --no-networking


    -N, --no-jailpurse:
        Default: jailpurse=enabled

        Do not copy the jailpurse tool
        folder into the guest system.
        Work with the raw image.

        Note: This inherently disables gcg
              logging while editing the 
              image.

        Example: gcgbuild -N
                 gcgbuild --no-jailpurse


    -o, --output-target:
        Default: "\e[4m/gcgbuild/images/custom\e0m"

        Choose destination to write custom image
        after it has been built.

        Example: gcgbuild -o ~/OpSystems
                 gcgbuild --output-target /tmp/build/gcg


    -t, --title:
        Default: "\e[4m/gcgbuild/images/custom\e0m"

        Choose destination to write custom image
        after it has been built.

        Example: gcgbuild -t "GCGLinux"
                 gcgbuild --title "Eunice"


    -v, --verbose: 
        Default: "\e[4mInfo\e0m"

        0 = Event  "Only notify for user action."
        1 = Info   "Notify when each step finishes."
        2 = Debug  "Print every step to STDOUT."
